# Texture Tales Case Study
This repository contains my solution for the SQL case study based on Texture Tales, A clothing company that sells lifestyle wear for the modern adventurer. 
The case study involves querying and manipulating data from a relational database that contains information about customers, products, orders, and payments.
The goal is to answer various business questions and generate insights about the sales performance of the company.
I used MsSQL   to write and execute the SQL queries 
You can find the database schema, the SQL queries, and the Power BI report in this repository.
